    This following is merely a tutorial tool within Festival about
    recording a (very) limited domain synthesizer.  Twenty-four utterances
    were recorded (on a home PC, hence the background noise) and a
    speaking clock was then automatically built from the recorded forms,
    using our standard software tools.  Although the results are not
    perfect, the ease of building such a synthesizer is quite attractive.
    <P>
    The recordings of the follow utterances were made 
    <pre>
  "The time is now, exactly five past one, in the morning."
  "The time is now, just after ten past two, in the morning."
  "The time is now, a little after quarter past three, in the morning."
  "The time is now, almost twenty past four, in the morning."
  "The time is now, exactly twenty-five past five, in the morning."
  "The time is now, just after half past six, in the morning."
  "The time is now, a little after twenty-five to seven, in the morning."
  "The time is now, almost twenty to eight, in the morning."
  "The time is now, exactly quarter to nine, in the morning."
  "The time is now, just after ten to ten, in the morning."
  "The time is now, a little after five to eleven, in the morning."
  "The time is now, almost twelve."
  "The time is now, just after five to one, in the afternoon."
  "The time is now, a little after ten to two, in the afternoon."
  "The time is now, exactly quarter to three, in the afternoon."
  "The time is now, almost twenty to four, in the afternoon."
  "The time is now, just after twenty-five to five, in the afternoon."
  "The time is now, a little after half past six, in the evening."
  "The time is now, exactly twenty-five past seven, in the evening."
  "The time is now, almost twenty past eight, in the evening."
  "The time is now, just after quarter past nine, in the evening."
  "The time is now, almost ten past ten, in the evening."
  "The time is now, exactly five past eleven, in the evening."
  "The time is now, a little after quarter to midnight."
    </pre>
    These were autoaligned and a cluster unit selection voice built
    from them (a fully automatic process).  The resulting synthesizer 
    can then speak any time (in the format of the database).
    <P>
    Full instructions and scripts to build such a limited domain synthesizer
    such as a speaking clock will be released with the next version of
    the <A HREF="../festvox/festvox_toc.html"><em>Building Voices in 
    Festival</em></a> document.  The database this voice was created
    from is available <A HREF="../examples/cmu_time_awb_ldom/">here</A>
