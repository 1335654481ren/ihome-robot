    The CMU_SIN database was constructed at the Language Technologies
    Institute at Carnegie Mellon University as a database of speech in noise
    designed for use in unit selection speech synthesis research. This work
    builds on the <a href="http://www.festvox.org/cmu_arctic">CMU 
    Arctic database</a>.  This work was carried out as part of the
    <a href="http://www.cmuletsgo.org">Let's Go Project</a> improving
    spoken dialog systems for non-natives and the elderly.
    </p><p>
    The distributions include a 500 utterance subset from the CMU
    Arctic database, recorded from one male US English speaker. There
    are two versions of these recordings: one where the speaking style
    is speech in noise (sin) and one with normal speaking style
    (swn). We also include two complete Festival voices built from
    these recordings. It is possible to build a voice from both sets
    of recordings that can speak both normally and in noise, though we
    are not distributing such a voice at this time. The distribution
    also contains the modifications to the FestVox voice building
    script prompt_them to provide a method of obtaining clean
    recordings of speech in noise, as well as the noise source used
    for these recordings.
    </p><p>
    Full phonetic labeling was performed with CMU Sphinx using the
    FestVox based labeling scripts. No hand-correction of the
    automatic labels has been done.
