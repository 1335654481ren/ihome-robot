    <P>
    July 31st-August 4th, 2000, at Carnegie Mellon Univeristy in
    Pittsburgh, Pennsylvannia.
    <P>     
    This 5-day course will allow attendees to gain practice in building
    synthetic voices for speech applications.  This course is aimed as
    developers of speech systems who wish to take better advantage
    of start of the art synthesis techniques.
    <P>
    The number of attendees to this course will be limited.  Course fees
    will be $2,500 per person.  Accommodation and meals are extra.
    To register please contact <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lenzo/">
    Kevin A. Lenzo</A> <A HREF="mailto:lenzo@cs.cmu.edu">(lenzo@cs.cmu.edu)</A>
    <P>
    Attendees of the course will:
    <UL>
    <LI> gain understanding the basic components of state-of-the-art 
    speech synthesis technology, and their relative complexity.</LI>
    <LI> gain practical experience in building new voices and trade-offs
    between general TTS (diphone, general unit selection) synthesizers 
    and targeted and limited domain synthesizers </LI>
    <LI> gain practical experience in tailoring voices and their
    applications to get the best compromise of quality, speed and
    ease of construction </LI>
    </UL>
    This course is based on 
    <A HREF="http://www.festvox.org/festvox/festvox_toc.html"> the
    FestVox Document</A> and uses Edinburgh University's
    <A HREF="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival.html">
    Festival Speech Synthesis System</A> in all practicals.  As these
    tools are free for commercial use, techniques learned in this course may
    be applied to building new commercial voices without further
    licencing.

    The course will involve lectures and practicals including complete
    walkthroughs for building your own voices so the attendees can
    fully gain experience in actually building voices.  Each attendee
    will be given access to a computer during the course.  Voices
    built using these techniques can be run on any platform Festival
    supports, which includes, Linux, Solaris, Windows etc.  However
    the course will use Linux workstations to demonstrate the use of
    the voice building tools.

    <P>
    The course will be taught and supervised by <A
    HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/">Alan W Black</A> and <A
    HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lenzo/">Kevin A. Lenzo.</A>
    <P>
    <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/">Alan W Black</A> is a
    principal author of the <A
    HREF="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival.html">Festival
    Speech Synthesis System</A> and has had many years experience in
    designing and building various speech synthesis systems in voices
    in various languagues, both in academia and industry.  Previous to
    that he has worked on a wide range of speech and language research
    projects all leading to practical implementations.
    <P>
    <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lenzo/">Kevin A. Lenzo.</A> also
    has many years experience in synthesis systems, both in academia
    and industry, working in a wide range of synthesis systems,
    including the development of PhoneBox, a multi-lingual unit
    selection synthesizer.  He is also a respected member of Perl
    Programming Language community, active in the open source
    lincencing movement and currently steward of the <A
    HREF="http://cmusphinx.org">CMU Sphinx</A> open source speech
    recognition project.
    <P>
    Both are committed to open source, and the transfer of technology
    from research to practical applications.  Together they have
    authored the <A HREF="http://festvox.org/">FestVox Document</A>,
    been part of building many voices in a number of
    different languages, and developed the technology to make the
    building of synthetic voices, better, more reliable, and available
    to a much larger community.
