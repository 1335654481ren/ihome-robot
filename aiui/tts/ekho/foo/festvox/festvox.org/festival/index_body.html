    University of Edinburgh's <a
    href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/"> 
    Festival Speech Synthesis Systems</a> is a free
    software multi-lingual speech synthesis workbench that runs on
    multiple-platforms offering black box text to speech, as well as
    an open architecture for research in speech synthesis.  It
    designed as a component of large speech technology systems.

    The distribution here includes source for the Edinburgh Speech Tools
    Library and Festival itself.  Voices are also provided for US English,
    other voices are available elsehwere on this site and instructions to
    build new voices are given <a href="../festvox/festvox_toc.html">

    Although we agressively attempt to run Festival on all platforms
    we can get access to it is not always the case that it works
    out of the box.  The hardest requirement is probably having a working
    and compatible audio system, simple as audio is supposed to be in
    our experience we find a wide range of standards.
     We do give pointers for dealing with
    audio systems we don't yet support, and offer and external playing
    mechainsm so if you have any programs that can play sound Festival can
    usually use that.
    <p>
    Festival is primarily designed as a component of a larger speech
    applicationm hence we provide a number of APIs.  It can be used
    to simply synthesize text files but to people who think command
    line interfaces are quaint you might find this not what you are
    looking for.
    <p>
    The system was (and still is) primarily developed under Unix (Linux,
    FreeBSD and Solaris) because the authors are by far most familar with 
    these.  However the system has been ported to Windows and is used 
    in a number of real applications on that platform.  Although there
    is full support for Windows we do not yet feel it is as mature or
    stable the versions under Unix.
    <p>
    The system is written in C++ which means with every new version of
    of each vendor's C++ compiler that is released our system probably
    wont compile without minor changes.  We try to keep up with new
    versions as quickly as we can, and make patches or instructions 
    available for new versions as soon as we can.
