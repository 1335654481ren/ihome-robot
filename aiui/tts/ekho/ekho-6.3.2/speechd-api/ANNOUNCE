Speech Dispatcher 0.7.1
=======================

The Brailcom organization is happy to announce the availability of
Speech Dispatcher 0.7.1 developed as a part of the Free(b)Soft
project. This is a minor release, it contains mostly bugfixes.  Please
read `NOTES' bellow.

* What is Speech Dispatcher?

  Speech Dispatcher is a device independent layer for speech
  synthesis, developed with the goal of making the usage of speech
  synthesis easier for application programmers. It takes care of most
  of the tasks necessary to solve in speech enabled applications. What
  is a very high level GUI library to graphics, Speech Dispatcher is
  to speech synthesis.

  Key Speech Dispatcher features are:

  - Message priority model that allows multiple simultaneous
    connections to Speech Dispatcher from one or more clients
    and tries to provide the user with the most important messages.

  - Different output modules that talk to different synthesizers so
    that the programmer doesn't need to care which particular
    synthesizer is being used. Currently Festival, Flite, Epos, Espeak
    and (non-free) Dectalk software, IBM TTS and others are supported.
    Festival is an advanced Free Software synthesizer supporting
    various languages. Espeak is a very fast multi-lingual
    synthesizer.

  - Simple interface for programs written in C, C++ provided through a
    shared library. Python, Common Lisp and Guile interface. An Elisp
    and Java libraries are developed as sperate projects speechd-el
    and speechd-java. Possibly an interface to any other language can
    be developed.

* What is new in 0.7.1?

 * Easy configuration of the client communication method using a single
   environment variable SPEECHD_ADDRESS.

 * Advanced autospawn -- server is autostarted only when its communication
   channel matches the communication channels requested by the client.
   Local server is not started  when client attempts to connect to a remote
   server.

 * Both libspeechd and python library now report a detailed error information
   in case of connection failure (why has connect failed, why was it not
   possible to autostart the server, what has the server reported etc.)
   Clients can directly show this information to the user and the user
   doesn't have to search them in logfiles.

 * Improvements in memmory usage

 * Cleanup of priorities of messages in logging output

 * Various bugfixes, cleanups and fine-tunnings

Apart from the ones mentioned, we are thankful to the many
developers who have contributed to this release.

NOTES: 

 * There are changes in the configuration file, it is recommended
   to replace your configuration with the new version

 * Common Lisp, Guile and Java libraries do not support the socket
   communication method in this release
