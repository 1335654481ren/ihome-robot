This is a Guile interface to SSIP.

It is in an experimental state now and is expected to be significantly
reworked before first official release.

To compile it, run `make'.  libspeechd and guile libraries and headers files
must be installed to get compiled the C part of the interface.

If you have any questions, suggestions, etc., feel free to contact us at the
mailing list <speechd@lists.freebsoft.org>.
