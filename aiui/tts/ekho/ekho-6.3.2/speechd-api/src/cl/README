This is a simple Common Lisp interface to Speech Dispatcher through the Speech
Synthesis Interface Protocol (SSIP).

Currently, there is no documentation, read the sources.
The simplest use can be as follows:

  (asdf:operate-on-system 'asdf:load-op :ssip)
  (ssip:say-text "Hello, world!")

It works with CLisp and SBCL, but it should be easy to port to other systems,
just add the support to sysdep.lisp.

Feel free to contact us with any questions regarding the Common Lisp interface
at the Speech Dispatcher mailing list <speechd@lists.freebsoft.org>.
