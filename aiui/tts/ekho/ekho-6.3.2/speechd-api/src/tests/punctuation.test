    "I quite agree with you," said the Duchess; "and the moral of
that is -- `Be what you would seem to be' -- or, if you'd like it put
more simply -- `Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it
might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not
otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be
otherwise.'"
        -- Lewis Carrol, "Alice in Wonderland"

A famous Lisp Hacker noticed an Undergraduate sitting in front of a Xerox
1108; trying to edit a complex Klone network via a browser. Wanting to
help, the Hacker clicked one of the nodes in the network with the mouse,
and asked "what do you see?" Very earnestly, the Undergraduate replied "I
see a cursor." The Hacker then quickly pressed the boot toggle at the back
of the keyboard, while simultaneously hitting the Undergraduate over the head
with a thick Interlisp Manual.  The Undergraduate was then Enlightened.

@ by the synthesizer, should be conserved.

!SPEAK
   I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have
   been only like a boy playing on the seashore, and diverting myself in now
   and then finding of a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary,
   whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.
        -- Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) English physicist, mathematician.
