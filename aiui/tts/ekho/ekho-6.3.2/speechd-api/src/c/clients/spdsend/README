$ spdsend --open HOST PORT

  Open new connection to Speech Dispatcher running at HOST:PORT and print the
  connection identifier on the standard output.

$ spdsend --close CONNECTION

  Close the given Speech Dispatcher CONNECTION.

$ spdsend --send CONNECTION

  Read an SSIP command from standard input, forward it to Speech Dispatcher
  CONNECTION and print the answer on the standard output.
