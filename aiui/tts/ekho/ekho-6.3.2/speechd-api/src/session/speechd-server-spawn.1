.SH NAME
speechd-server-spawn \- A script to assist with the loading of speech-dispatcher from the C and Python APIs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B speechd-server-spawn
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B speechd-server-spawn
Is a script to assist with the automatic loading of a speech-dispatcher server process for client applications using the python or C APIs. If no speech-dispatcher server is running, it will load speech-dispatcher as the current user, or if root, the system speech-dispatcher process using the system level init script, specified at package build time. This command does not take any user input. The script will return the PID of speech-dispatcher either once the speech-dispatcher server is started, or if speech-dispatcher is already running.
