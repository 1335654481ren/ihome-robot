All project documentation is written using Texinfo.
(You can get the latest texinfo.tex from
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo.tex (and all GNU mirrors))

The Makefile in this directory allows you to build the documentation from
Texinfo sources in one of these formats: info, HTML, DVI and PDF.

To build one of supported formats, run "make <format>", Where <format> is
supplyed by name of the format in lowercase.
	
For example:
	make info

The make process REQUIRES:
	* Texinfo
	* Tex (for generating PDF and DVI)
